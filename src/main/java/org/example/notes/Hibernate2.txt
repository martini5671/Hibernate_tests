This code snippet demonstrates the difference between getReference() and find() methods in JPA and how to use the refresh() method to update an entity with the latest database values.

Key Points:

getReference():

Returns a proxy object that represents the entity with the specified ID.
Lazy loading: It will only issue a select query to the database when an operation (like accessing an attribute) is performed on the proxy object.
Useful when you need to represent an entity without immediately fetching it from the database.
find():

Returns the actual entity object from the database.
Eager loading: It fetches the entity from the database immediately.
Preferred when you need to work with the entity's data directly.
refresh():

Refreshes the entity object from the database, overriding any local changes.
Useful for ensuring the entity reflects the latest state in the database.
Essentially acts as an undo operation for changes made to the entity in the context before commit.
Example Code:

The code uses getReference() to retrieve an Employee object with ID 12.
It modifies the address attribute of the proxy object.
Before calling refresh(), the address attribute displays the modified value.
After calling refresh(), the address attribute is reset to the original value stored in the database.
Summary:

The code demonstrates that:

Using getReference() allows for lazy loading, reducing the number of queries to the database.
Using refresh() allows you to re-sync the entity object with the database, effectively undoing any local changes.
This approach is useful when you want to minimize database interactions and ensure that the entity object reflects the latest state in the database.
